I want you to design and develop an old school RPG adventure game.  The kind that your dad would have played on his old ZX Speccy back in the day.

No fancy graphics, no orchestral sound, just text on a screen.  Lots and lots of text on a screen.

I’ll outline what I want over the next few slides, then its over to you.  Lets get cracking!



Part 1 – Hero Creation
The user creates a hero. They give the hero a name.  They hero must have the following values:

-Health
-Damage
-Lives
-Kills
-Gold

How you implement this is up to you.


Part 2 – The World
The hero moves through a world.  They come to crossroads.  At the crossroads there may be monsters blocking the hero's way.  The hero can fight or run.

Occasionally they will be a shop where the hero can upgrade their health & weapons.

How you implement this is up to you.


Part 3 - Fighting
The monster has a health & defence value like the hero.  How you implement this is up to you.

They fight in a series of rounds.  If the hero’s health goes to 0 they lose a life and go back to the start.  If the monster’s health goes to 0 they die.  The hero gets access to a treasure box full of gold.

How you implement this is up to you.




Part 4 – The Shop
Occasionally the hero will have access to a shop.  Here they can replenish their health, increase their health by 20% or increase their damage by 20%.  

How you implement this is up to you.


Part 4 – Death and Leader board
When the hero is dead, their stats need to be saved to a file.
Then all previous hero's stats need to be displayed on screen.  

How you implement this is up to you.
The game then starts again and a new hero is created.
